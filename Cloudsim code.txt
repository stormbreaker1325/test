Open Eclipse

Create a new Java Project: File -> New

Import an unpacked CloudSim project into the new Java Project. Copy all the files from the sfh scheduling folder and paste in the project folder along with the utils.



CloudSim.init(num user, calendar, trace flag)


Datacenter datacenter9883 = new Datacenter(name, characteristics, new
VmAllocationPolicySimple(hostList),s


DatacenterBroker broker = createBroker);


Vm vm = new Vm/vmid, brokerld, mips, pesNumber, ram, bw, size, vmm, new
CloudletSchedulerTimeShared())


broker.submitVmList(vmlist)


Cloudlet cloudlet = new Cloudlet(id, length, pesNumber, fileSize, outputSize,
utilizationModel, utilizationMode)


broker.submitCloudletList(cloudletList)


CloudSim.startSimulation()



After the coding part is complete, we need to build path to the cloudsim directory.

Right click on the project's parent directory and choose build path, followed by libraries.

Add external jars file named "CloudSim-3.0.jar" from the CloudSim-> jars folder.

Click ok and apply, then run the project to get the output.
